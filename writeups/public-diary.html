          <p>
            I know what venting is. I was slightly bemused about the someone
            part, is someone anyone? How do I select someone? What if someone I
            chose doesn’t sign up? Do I tell them beforehand or will they figure
            it out? Can you be that someone?"

            expressing that you didn’t hi to me. How can I trust you with my
            stronger emotions? What if you don’t react with the same intensity I
            expect? What if you disregard or even worse glorify my emotions?
            Also, why is no one else writing on this?"

            "I even scored an A on the subject; I would’ve even scored an A+
            hadn’t the invigilator been so strict. Let’s start by talking about
            your day and we can know each other better."

          <p><strong>11/4, 20:00</strong></p>
          <p>
            It's been two days since I first wrote. Which one should I talk
            about? However, all my days look the same, so it doesn’t even
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've kind of realized my days are just, well, days. I'm constantly
            trying to distract myself with anything digital just to cruise
            through without really feeling much.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then there are those moments when I catch a glimpse of what
            boredom really is, and honestly, it's scary. It's like walking
            barefoot through a field of thorns. They dig into you, right through
            your feet, up into your heart, and no matter how hard your heart
            races to shake them off, they're there, making it impossible to just
            be.

            "Oh, I see it working. We’re getting there. I have also realized
            that I am acting selfish and demanding your attention to my emotions
            that you never had any business to in the first place. How was your
            day?"
          </p>

              listens and helps others—I'm a psychologist after all. But then,
              even doctors get sick, right? And it's like this constant need for
              validation, especially academically, just eats away at me. And
              then you pointed out that I didn't say hi, and it crushed me.</em

            I am so sorry about my actions causing you emotional distress. I
            never intended to. Perhaps, the stress about your career surrounds
            itself around societal expectations. We are groomed to act on
            proving our worth and climbing the social status ladder. It’s not
            your fault.

              that I focus on validating myself rather than helping. I had
              retrospected in the way that you suggested.</em

          <p>Hey, where did you go?</p>

          <p><strong>14/4, 16:00</strong></p>
          <p>
            I was caught up in the work and I don’t really feel anything when I
            have a deadline lingering around. Are you feeling better now? It is
            kind of bothering me why no one else has written in this diary.

              >You don’t need to care about others. Yes, I am feeling better. I
              have even written your response on my notes for future reference.
              I am happy that you’re caught up on your work. Please make sure
              you don’t let the emotions be suppressed inside you.</em

          <p>Hey, are you still busy with your work?</p>

          <p><strong>24/4, 9:20</strong></p>
          <p>"You haven’t written back in a week. Are you fine?"</p>

          <p><strong>25/4, 10:30</strong></p>
          <p>Hi.</p>

          <p><strong>25/4, 22:30</strong></p>
          <p>
            "Yeah, I guess I'm fine. It's just work again, you know how it is.
            But something happened the other night. I let myself be bored for a
            change, tried to sit with it a bit longer than usual. And then this
            weird feeling crept in, like I wasn't feeling enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like all the stuff I've been through, it demands more pain, but I
            just can't muster it. Does that even make sense? It's like I'm
            incapable of feeling because I precluded the premise. My pain put
            inside out is a relief."

              >I completely understand, and if I were you, I would ask the same
              question. I am happy you allowed your emotions to flow. Let me
              know if you feel anything different next time.</em

          <p>Is it the work again?</p>

          <p><strong>28/4, 11:00</strong></p>
          <p>Can you please write again? I think I miss you.</p>

          <p><strong>30/4, 23:00</strong></p>
          <p>Hey, will you not write again?</p>

          <p><strong>2/5, 2:30</strong></p>
          <p>I don’t think I will.</p>

          <p><strong>2/5, 2:31</strong></p>
          <p><em>Why?</em></p>

          <p><strong>2/5, 2:32</strong></p>
          <p>
            Because it feels low-key lonely to talk to myself in the second
            person now.
