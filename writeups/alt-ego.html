<p>"You know what Shashwat, I'm done. I'm done with a heartless liar," he says while wiping his tears and gasping for air.</p>

<p>Despite trying to be brave, the tears started to fall again.</p>

<p>"Why did you do this to me, Shashwat? Why did you sell me false dreams? Whyyy"</p>

<p>"Dreams? What dreams?" I asked, confused.</p>

<p>"You told me we would travel the world together, that these pages would be filled with colorful visas. But instead, you chose to leave me here, stuck under this mattress. You sold me hope, all for nothing," he sobbed.</p>

<p>"But I am trying to make things better," I said.</p>

<p>"No, you aren't," it screams.</p>

<p>"My life would be better in the paper pouch of the studio rather than this lavish loneliness..."</p>

<p>I shut the passport book but the whining only got louder.</p>

<p>"Again, this is all you do. You shut me up again. Perhaps, this is all you can do."</p>

<p>I felt a shiver run down my spine as I detected the anger in his voice.</p>

<p>"You have no skill or guts to start something or make yourself valuable to society. It's not just about the money, it's about your skills—or lack thereof. You're never going to amount to anything in this society. You're just average, mediocre, unremarkable."</p>

<p>I felt a pang of hurt in my chest as I asked, "Why would you say that?"</p>

<p>"You lack the talent, the creativity, the drive to succeed. You're shit."</p>

<p>"No u."</p>
